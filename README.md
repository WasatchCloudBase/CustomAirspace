Script to create a custom airspace file for FlySkyHy.

The custom airspace is used to identify:
 - Landing Zones
 - Do Not Land areas
 - Seasonal raptor closure areas
 - Thermal hot spots (extracts from https://thermal.kk7.ch)

See the header for the custom airspace text file for info on updating FlySkyHy airspace settings.
